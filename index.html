    The ancient cultures of Mesopotamia, the Indian subcontinent, and China, among others, produced renowned surgeons
    and students of the natural sciences such as Susruta and Zhang Zhongjing, reflecting independent sophisticated
    systems of natural philosophy. Taoist philosophers, such as Zhuangzi in the 4th century BC, expressed ideas related
    to evolution, such as denying the fixity of biological species and speculating that species had developed differing
    attributes in response to differing environments.[2] The ancient Indian Ayurveda tradition independently developed
    the concept of three humours, resembling that of the four humours of ancient Greek medicine, though the Ayurvedic
    system included further complications, such as the body being composed of five elements and seven basic tissues.
    Ayurvedic writers also classified living things into four categories based on the method of birth (from the womb,
    eggs, heat & moisture, and seeds) and explained the conception of a fetus in detail. They also made considerable
    advances in the field of surgery, often without the use of human dissection or animal vivisection.[3] One of the
    earliest Ayurvedic treatises was the Sushruta Samhita, attributed to Sushruta in the 6th century BC. It was also an
    early materia medica, describing 700 medicinal plants, 64 preparations from mineral sources, and 57 preparations
    based on animal sources.[4] However, the roots of modern zoology are usually traced back to the secular tradition of
    ancient Greek philosophy.[5]
