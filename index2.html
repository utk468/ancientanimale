    Ancient Greek traditions
    The pre-Socratic philosophers asked many questions about life but produced little systematic knowledge of
    specifically zoological interestâ€”though the attempts of the atomists to explain life in purely physical terms would
    recur periodically through the history of zoology. However, the medical theories of Hippocrates and his followers,
    especially humorism, had a lasting impact.[6]

    The philosopher Aristotle created the science of biology, basing its theory on both his metaphysical principles and
    on observation. He proposed theories for the processes of metabolism, temperature regulation, information
    processing, embryonic development and inheritance. He made detailed observations of nature, especially the habits
    and attributes of animals in the sea at Lesbos. He classified 540 animal species, and dissected at least
    50.[7][8][9]

    Aristotle, and nearly all Western scholars after him until the 18th century, believed that creatures were arranged
    in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to humans: the scala naturae or Great Chain of Being.[10]
