    Ancient Greek traditions
    The pre-Socratic philosophers asked many questions about life but produced little systematic knowledge of
    specifically zoological interestâ€”though the attempts of the atomists to explain life in purely physical terms would
    recur periodically through the history of zoology. However, the medical theories of Hippocrates and his followers,
    especially humorism, had a lasting impact.[6]
